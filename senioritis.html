    <h1>What is the Issue</h1>
    <p>Senioritis is a colloquial term used to describe the lack of motivation and decreased effort often observed in high school seniors as they approach graduation. This phenomenon affects a significant portion of students, with studies indicating that approximately 78% of high school seniors in America experience senioritis. The onset of senioritis can lead to a noticeable decline in school attendance, reduced attention in class, and a drop in academic performance. This disengagement is typically attributed to a mix of exhaustion from years of academic effort and a sense of complacency after receiving college acceptance letters or making post-graduation plans.</p>
    
    <h1>My Solution</h1>
    <p>The solution for senioritis involves creating a program that leverages data on grades, GPA changes, and attendance to identify early indicators of significant academic changes among high school seniors. By analyzing historical data, the program uses predictive modeling to forecast potential academic challenges and generate real-time alerts for educators. These alerts indicate when a student's performance is approaching or exceeding predefined thresholds of concern, along with an assessment of the severity of the change. An educator dashboard provides a user-friendly interface displaying these insights, alert statuses, and personalized intervention recommendations. This enables educators to proactively support students, ensuring timely interventions to maintain or improve academic performance and engagement throughout their senior year.</p>
